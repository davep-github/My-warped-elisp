#
# This is a pdbx filter.  After a matching record from a pdb query is
# collected, a routine like this is called if it is
# specified on the command line.
#
# This routine is called with no parameters, but three global items 
# are defined:
# %fields, @thisRec and $fieldIndex
# %fields is indexed directly by a field's name.  This variable does not
#  preserve any kind of ordering from the original record in the database.
# @thisRec contains pairs of strings.
#  $thisRec[i] is the name of the field
#  $thisRec[i+1] is the value of the field.
# This variable preserves the order from the database; it is pretty much
#  a copy of the record as it was in the file.
# $fieldIndex is the index of the next slot to use in @thisRec.
#
# In specific, this is a mail alias pdbx. The main alias filter,
# alias-list.pdbx, is a generic filter designed to handle mail aliases
# and alias lists.
# Each pdb record which fits the profile: 
# a field named alias.  Value can be a|b|c. All alternatives are looped thru
#  with each alternaive put into $alias
# a field named: (email)(.*)
# (.*) is stuffed into $alias_suffix.
# $alias_name is set to "$alias$alias_suffix"
# lists have ',' in them and their expansion is deferred.
# aliases are formatted via a call to rs_format_value.
# this is stored in an array: $rs_aliases{$alias_name} for
#  later use in expanding lists.
# rs_format_value prints the alias value to the stdout and
#  returns same as string to be added to @rs_aliases.
