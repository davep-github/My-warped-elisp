#
# This is a pdbx filter.  After a matching record from a pdb query is
# collected, a routine like this is called if it is
# specified on the command line.
#
# This routine is called with no parameters, but three global items 
# are defined:
# %fields, @thisRec and $fieldIndex
# %fields is indexed directly by a field's name.  This variable does not
#  preserve any kind of ordering from the original record in the database.
# @thisRec contains pairs of strings.
#  $thisRec[i] is the name of the field
#  $thisRec[i+1] is the value of the field.
# This variable preserves the order from the database; it is pretty much
#  a copy of the record as it was in the file.
# $fieldIndex is the index of the next slot to use in @thisRec.
