This should go last in the path.
If something cannot be found in a better place, then something
almost, but not quite entirely useless can be fallen back to
in here.
For example, I find realpath essential. It isn't everwhere I'd
like it to be. So here is a minimal version that gets the basic
job done. This one will only be used if nothing better is found.
