# Original motivation:
# In $HOME, find all of my links which point into a vc repository.

# My current system has a repository living "somewhere" and I link things
# like bin, .rc, so on (can't say etc :-) so that my things can be put into
# use in another site in an incremental fashion. If that's possible, given my
# .rc's dependence on bin, and my bin's dependence on .rc funcs, aliases, and
# so on.

# In addition, I put "non-essential" things on other disks but want them in my dir tree.
# e.g. I have a place for browser caches, downloaded docs, etc. This can
# catch those as well.
#
# But now this just find(1)s symlinks and prints them in a easy to use format.
# It will feed find dir symlinks, etc.
