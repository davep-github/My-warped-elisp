# Running things without my environment getting in the way.
# See also: run-and-cut, which does an ssh to a new machine in such a way as
# to start up a clean, non-davep login.
# If I do env - bash.
# A make in <some-client>/src fails.
# If I then do: export PATH
# it works.
# Before the export, there is still a PATH variable but it isn't, apparently,
# exported. Ie you can echo $PATH and see something.
# The PATH=$PATH is an attempt to make sure it's an environment var and not
# just a shell variable.
# DP_BYPASS_BASHRC=Yes makes my .bashrc exit very early.


# pass an environment variable saying don't run bashrc.
