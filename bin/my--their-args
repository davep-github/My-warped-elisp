# I have many utils that are wrappers around other programs, like *grep.
# E.g. rcgrep.  This greps all of my currently active bash rc files.
# 99+% of the time, options are for the grepper, esp -i.
# I'd like to be able to specify args to the wrapper and to the wrapped.
# My feeling is that most of the times the args are for the wrapped.
