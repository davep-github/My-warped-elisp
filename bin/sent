Chris,

Did you ever get my resume?  I sent it after we 
had lunch.  But your extended silence plus the lack of any
akamai addresses in my sendmail logs is leading me to think
you never got it.

Please let me know one way or the other.

Yes.
I was, but didn't read my email yesterday.
Any time today is good, though.
Give a ring anytime:
1) Not here --> vmail (or try again.  I'm pretty slow and the cordless
is in my office, at the end of the path of death.  Notice the lack of
quotes here.
2) Can't --> "Can't." said davep.
3) Can --> chat.

Steve,
I have an appt here in Reading ~6pm.
So, rather than come in and leave ~4:39:27
(or so) in order to guarantee I'm here by 6pm so
we can make the 90sec trip to sk00l (everything's 
70 < t < 110 sec from our house: {YMCA for preK, K, 
grammour school, middle school, high school and 
playground.  My wife worked for years to find this
(supra-prime mortgaged) house),
I going to work from home.
(did I lose (you) in all of those parens (i.e. [)(]))?

Never thought of that.
Actually, we {wife[0], self->personality[0]} are huge Tolkien Geeks.
For daughter[0], we were going to leave her middle name
blank so she could choose it later.  But the robo-nurses
@ the hospital couldn't grok that and said we couldn't do
it.  We were too tired to complain, so we went with the 
fallback of Arwen, which isn't odd enough to cause trauma.
Daughter[1] is SAMantha Rose.
But bitch[0]'s name is Paw-Prints (90+ lb Golden Retriever) which
is, of course, normal.

Meduseld is the Golden Hall in Rohan.
Withywindle is the river ~from which the queerness of the Old Forest
comes~
Crickhollow is the house Frodo pretended to move to.

Perhaps I've said too much.
