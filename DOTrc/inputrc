# For more information on how this file works, please see the
# INITIALIZATION FILE section of the readline(3) man page
#
# Quick dirty little note:
#  To get the key sequence for binding, you can abuse bash.
#  While running bash, hit CTRL+V, and then type the key sequence.
#  So, typing 'ALT + left arrow' in Konsole gets you back:
#    ^[[1;3D
#  The readline entry to make this skip back a word will then be:
#    "\e[1;3D" backward-word
# The above courtesy of Funtoo's /etc/inputrc.
# Also, in vim, ^V works as well and what's more will insert it into the file.
# I had been using `hd' (a hex dumper) but C-v is more universal.
# 8Bits supports.
