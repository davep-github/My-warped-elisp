# Imagine you have a program with an interface like the following

# dog0 -h | --help
# dog0 quietly [--silent] <message>
# dog0 loudly [--repeat=<number>] <message>

# This imaginary program has two command quietly and loudly that each have
# distinct arguments you can pass to them – ideally we’d like the completion
# script to complete -h, --help, quietly, and loudly when no commands are
# supplied, and once either quietly or loudly has been entered it should give
# context specific completions for those.

# The following zsh script provides completions for the program as
# described. In the rest of the post I’ll give an explanation of the general
# outline of the script and dive into some of the more interesting parts.

# see [/home/davep/DOTrc/zsh/completions/]simple-example.zsh
