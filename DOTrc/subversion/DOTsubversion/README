This directory holds run-time configuration information for Subversion
clients.  The configuration files all share the same syntax, but you
should examine a particular file to learn what configuration
directives are valid for that file.

The syntax is standard INI format:

   - Empty lines, and lines starting with '#', are ignored.
     The first significant line in a file must be a section header.

   - A section starts with a section header, which must start in
     the first column:

       [section-name]

   - An option, which must always appear within a section, is a pair
     (name, value).  There are two valid forms for defining an
     option, both of which must start in the first column:

       name: value
       name = value

     Whitespace around the separator (:, =) is optional.

   - Section and option names are case-insensitive, but case is
     preserved.

   - An option's value may be broken into several lines.  The value
     continuation lines must start with at least one whitespace.
     Trailing whitespace in the previous line, the newline character
     and the leading whitespace in the continuation line is compressed
     into a single space character.

   - All leading and trailing whitespace around a value is trimmed,
     but the whitespace within a value is preserved, with the
     exception of whitespace around line continuations, as
     described above.

   - When a value is a list, it is comma-separated.  Again, the
     whitespace around each element of the list is trimmed.


Configuration data in the Windows registry
==========================================

On Windows, configuration data may also be stored in the registry.  The
functions svn_config_read and svn_config_merge will read from the
registry when passed file names of the form:

   REGISTRY:<hive>/path/to/config-key

The REGISTRY: prefix must be in upper case. The <hive> part must be
one of:

   HKLM for HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
   HKCU for HKEY_CURRENT_USER

The values in config-key represent the options in the [DEFAULTS] section.
The keys below config-key represent other sections, and their values
represent the options. Only values of type REG_SZ will be used; other
values, as well as the keys' default values, will be ignored.


File locations
==============

Typically, Subversion uses two config directories, one for site-wide
configuration,

  /etc/subversion/proxies
  /etc/subversion/config
  /etc/subversion/hairstyles
     -- or --
  REGISTRY:HKLM\Software\Tigris.org\Subversion\Proxies
  REGISTRY:HKLM\Software\Tigris.org\Subversion\Config
  REGISTRY:HKLM\Software\Tigris.org\Subversion\Hairstyles

and one for per-user configuration:

  ~/.subversion/proxies
  ~/.subversion/config
  ~/.subversion/hairstyles
     -- or --
  REGISTRY:HKCU\Software\Tigris.org\Subversion\Proxies
  REGISTRY:HKCU\Software\Tigris.org\Subversion\Config
  REGISTRY:HKCU\Software\Tigris.org\Subversion\Hairstyles
