### This file determines which proxy servers to use, if
### any, when contacting a remote repository and the duration
### of the timeout waiting for a response from the server.
###
### The commented-out examples below are intended only to
### demonstrate how to use this file; any resemblance to
### actual servers, living or dead, is entirely
### coincidental.

### In this section, the URL of the repository you're
### trying to access is matched against the patterns on
### the right.  If a match is found, the server info is
### taken from the section with the corresponding name.
### Timeouts, if given, are specified in seconds.  A timeout
### of 0, i.e. zero, causes a builtin default to be used.
# [groups]
# group1 = *.collab.net
# othergroup = repository.blarggitywhoomph.com

### Information for the first group:
# [group1]
# host = proxy1.some-domain-name.com
# port = 80
# username = blah
# password = doubleblah
# timeout = 60

### Information for the second group:
# [othergroup]
# host = proxy2.some-domain-name.com
# port = 9000
# No username and password, so use the defaults below.

### If there is a `default' section, then anything not set
### by a specifically matched group is taken from the
### defaults.  Thus, if you go through the same proxy
### server to reach every site on the Internet, you
### probably just want to put that server's information in
### the `default' section and not bother with `groups' or
### any other sections.
### 
### If you go through a proxy for all but a few sites, you can
### list those exceptions under `no_proxy', see below.  This only
### overrides defaults, not explicitly matched proxies.
# [default]
# no_proxy = *.exception.com, www.internal-site.org
# host = defaultproxy.whatever.com
# port = 7000
# username = defaultusername
# password = defaultpassword
# No timeout, so just use the builtin default.
