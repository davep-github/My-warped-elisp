Thanks a bunch!
Yes, I have some active prospects:
1) Conley -- A company in much the same position MDI was when I joined: a
a startup on the verge of "making it big."  Doing SCSI/RAID.
2) DEC's Cambridge Research Lab -- doing cluster technology and need an
engineer to help build prototypes and possibly join in on some research.
3) Sun MicroSystems -- many kernel/OS dirvers, etc.  Some real-time stuff.

There may be more as time goes by.

Burlington, MA. Near Boston.
I figured that it would be best to move into a very
active market like this.

Today we're snowed in from the "Blizzard of '97"


How're things there?  Still having fun?

Thanks again!
