Keep a journal of things done, discovered, to do, etc. in a jounral.
Journal will be split into per month files in `dnf' name format.

A journal will be multi-threaded on multiple topics.
journal-mode will allow selective display of topics.

A separate file will cantain topic definitions, with a description and
keywords.  There will be operations on the topics like:
find-topic-with-keywords, define-topic, etc.

Starting a new topic will prompt for a topic with completion for
existing topic.  Topic file will look like a journal file with
keyword: value lines.  

Timestamp:

========================
2002-01-12T10:52:25
<topic-name>
--

Timestamps optionally declare a topic beginning.
M-x nt -------> new-topic, prompt with completion for topic.  Insert a
timestamp/topic header


Should show-topic set a string which is used in next-in-topic?
If not set, then extract current topic for next-in-topic.


Searches
--------
They are done two ways, by an re embedded in a larger re that finds
topics:
"================\n<timestamp>\n\\(<topic-re>\\)\n--\n"a

The other way is to find all topic headers:
"================\n<timestamp>\n\\(.+\\)\n--\n"a

And then apply another re to the matched topic.
The specified re's have slightly different semantics.
Case two has an implied .*<re>.* around it, whereas
Case one has an implied ^<re>$ around it.
