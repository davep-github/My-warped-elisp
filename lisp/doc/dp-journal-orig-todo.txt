Set up font lock keywords based on current command.
This will allow us to specify possibly more useful colorings since we
will be able to know what the output will look like.

e.g.
ls --> add (^|[\t ]+)(.*~)[\n\t ] --> uninteresting font
(colorize like a colorized ls might)

trick out term-mode.
Want: char-mode when at-or-past process-mark,
line-mode elsewhere.
Is there any hook we can use?
?? Bind all keys to one function.  It will then interpret the key
based on its position.

I hook, create keymap w/all keys bound to my func.
In that, if (< point current-pmark-point)
 use line-mode map (standard emacs global map)
otherwise term-cmode map)
<<< cannot get this to work

>>> Try to hook motion commands:
mouse click -> set mode base upon destination
goto end of buffer --> set to char mode
{next|prev}-line -> set based on destination
-------> used post-command-hook.

Need different char and line mode bindings set up.
Some stuff from common hook is needed, but not all bindings.
Move bindings to a binding function.

line-mode/shell: keep as is.

char mode:
up		x
down		x
M-`		x
[home]		x
C-a		x
C-z		x

M-n		y
C-up		y
C-down		y
M-left		y
M-right		y
C-M-l		y

# Add to .inputrc and to char mode

C-left --> \eOd
C-right -> \eOc
C-a
C-e

make a cleanup function
Del buffers: if unmodified
 \\*Help: .*		mode == Help
 \\*Completions		mode == Completion List
 \\Man: .*		mode == Manual

done.

daily notes.
Would be nice if notes coule be grouped according to a topic.
A notes mode could gather topics from current or all files and allow
them to be input for a note sequence.

<date-stamp>
<topicX>
note related to topicX
note related to topicX
etc

<topicY>
note related to topicY
note related to topicY
etc

Want to be able to view by topic.

A topic proceeds from a <topip> stmt to a different <topic> stmt or to
EOF.  Dates/timestamps are in the *following* topic, if the topic is
immediately after the stamp.
