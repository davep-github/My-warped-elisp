	* list-mode.el (next-list-mode-item):
	Changed calls to {next|previous}-single-property-change to
	{next|previous}-single-char-property-change. The previous and next
	list item commands were not working: they always sent you to the
	end of the buffer since the properties on the list items were not
	text properties, and {next|previous}-single-property-change only
	look for changes in text properties.
