	* saveconf.el (recover-context): 
	Fixed bug when attempting to restore a file that no longer
	exists.  In this case, the restore loop deletes the buffer but
	does not read the following file offset.  This puts the restore
	loop out of alignment with the data in the restore file, which
	causes the loop to terminate possibly leaving some context
	unprocessed.
